## Who am I?

### As a person
I'm a second year student at the **Univeristy of California, San Diego** *(UCSD)* pursuing a **_Computer Science_, BS** degree and possibly a minor in ***Business***. I was born in *Boston, MA* but lived in *San Diego, CA* for most of my life. In my freetime, I like to cook, go to the beach and hang out with friends ~~unless they want to go hiking yuck~~. Although I'm only 20 and have many more years ahead of me, I like to thik of the quote:
> Here I am, I've come so far
